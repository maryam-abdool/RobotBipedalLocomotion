# RobotBipedalLocomotion

The project uses NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies), which is a method for evolving artificial neural networks with a genetic algorithm, to train the bipedal robot to run as fast as possible.

Run evolve-feedforward.py to train the robot first, and then run testneat.py to test the result.

Note: installation of NEAT-Python, OpenAI Gym, and MuJuCo are required for the project to work. Links to download those dependencies:
NEAT-Python: https://neat-python.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html
OpenAI Gym: https://gym.openai.com/docs/#installation
MuJuCo: https://mujoco.org/download

An example demo of the result after testing is the video shown below:
